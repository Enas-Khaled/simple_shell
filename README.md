# Simple Shell Project

For ALX 

## Content:

It is supposed to :
* Show a prompt to the user and wait for them to input a command. Each command should be followed by a new line.
* After executing a command, display the prompt again.
* The commands should be simple and consist of a single word. They should not contain semicolons, pipes, redirections, or any advanced features.
* Programs invoked by the commands should not receive any arguments.
* If an executable cannot be found, show an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors appropriately.
* Account for the "end of file" condition triggered by Ctrl+D.
